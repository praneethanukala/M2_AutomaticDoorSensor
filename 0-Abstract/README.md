Abstract:Door sensor for automatic lighting control is widely being developed for energy saving and security purposes. An infrared door sensor based on electrical and electronics combinational circuit technology is used to develop the automatic light switching system. The automatic light switching system will lead to energy saving and efficient energy usage which could benefit every single individual. Furthermore, the system is developed with safety environment when switching `ON' or `OFF' the light during the room occupancy or unoccupancy. Apart from safety environment, it also comprises manual switching in case user needs to have light during the day. Basically, this system is designed to be installed in the restroom.
