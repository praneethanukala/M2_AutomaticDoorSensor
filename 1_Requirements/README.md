# Abstract:
Door sensor for automatic lighting control is widely being developed for energy saving and security purposes. An infrared door sensor based on electrical and electronics combinational circuit technology is used to develop the automatic light switching system. The automatic light switching system will lead to energy saving and efficient energy usage which could benefit every single individual. Furthermore, the system is developed with safety environment when switching `ON' or `OFF' the light during the room occupancy or unoccupancy. Apart from safety environment, it also comprises manual switching in case user needs to have light during the day. Basically, this system is designed to be installed in the restroom.

# 4W & H (WHO,WHAT,WHEN,WHERE,HOW):
## * WHO:
A DOOR SENSOR IS THE APPLICATION USED TO DETECT THE PERSONS NEAR THE SENSOR.
## * WHAT:
HIGH RELIABILITY.
## * WHEN:
IT CAN BE USED ANY TIME MOSTLY.
## * WHERE:
PRESENCE OF NEAR BY OBJECTS
## * HOW:
EASY TO USE AND ADJUSTED IN A SHORT RANGE.
# * SWOT(STRENGTH,WEAKNESS,OPPORTUNITY,THREATS)
## * STRENGTH:
IT IS LESS IN PRICE.
HELPS IN SECURITY SYSTEM.
TYPE OF ALERT WE GET ONCE THYE DOOR OPENS.
WE CAN CHOOSE ALARAM OR LED TO ACTIVATE.
## * WEAKNESS:
LIMITED RANGE.
## * OPPORTUNITY:
INTERNET OF THINGS(IOT).
DOOR SENSOR DEVICES MARKETT UPCOMING TRENDS.
## * THREATS:
SENSOR DIS CONNECTION.
FAILURE OF THE COMPONENTS.
MORE POWER CONSUMPTION.
